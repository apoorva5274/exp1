<h2>What is potable water?</h2><h4.5>
Potable water is water that is safe for drinking. It comes from surface and ground sources and is treated to levels that meet state and federal standards for consumption. Water from natural sources is treated for microorganisms, bacteria, toxic chemicals, viruses and fecal matter. <br>
'Potable' comes from the Latin 'potare', meaning "to drink." The Romans came up with the word and built some of the world's first aqueducts, above-ground channels that brought potable water from the mountains to the cities.<br>
Tap water has usually been treated by the local municipality to make it potable, but there are times when the supply has been contaminated and you must treat water before using it.<br>
During the whole coarse,the water passes through the plains and valleys and become polluted and can't be consumed by human beings directly while on the contrary the potable water is the water which can be consumed by humans directly.<br>
Rainwater is safe to drink for the most part however, drinking rainwater directly from the source can sometimes be risky as it can pick up contaminants from the air and can even include the occasional insect parts.<br>
Water that's safe to drink should ideally be clear with no odor or funny taste. If your tap water tastes metallic, smells fishy, or comes out cloudy, it could signal the presence of unsafe contaminants.</h4.5><br><br>
<h2>How to make water potable?</h2><h4.5>
Water is purified by various processes; by using UV light, water purifier, reverse osmosis, distillation, boiling, chlorination etc.</h4.5><h3>
UV filter</h3><h4.5>
UV water purification systems purify water by using ultraviolet rays to kill microorganisms present in the water. UV rays completely kill water-borne microorganisms and prevent their reproduction by disrupting their DNA. Also, UV rays do not lead to chemical changes in the water.</h4.5><h3>
Reverse osmosis</h3><h4.5>
Reverse osmosis is the process of filtering water through a semi-permeable membrane. Even though it removes sediments and particles like dirt and dust, it is not the most effiecient as it does not kill microbes that may be present in the water.</h4.5><h3>
Distillation</h3><h4.5>
Distillation of water involves boiling water and collecting the vapour and leaving the bacteria and contaminants behind. Distilled water is one of the purest forms of water, 98% of the contaminants are removed from the home distillation system and it gives water which is purer than that from filters. While distilled water is pure, it may not have the necessary minerals and nutrients one needs to acquire from water.</h4.5><h3>
Boiling</h3><h4.5>
Boiling is the surest method to kill disease-causing germs, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Adding a pinch of salt for each quart or liter of boiled water is also reccomended.</h4.5><h3>
Chlorination </h3><h4.5>
Chlorine kills pathogens such as bacteria and viruses by breaking the chemical bonds in their molecules. Disinfectants that are used for this purpose consist of chlorine compounds which can exchange atoms with other compounds, such as enzymes in bacteria and other cells.</h4.5><br><br>
<h2>The current situation</h2>
<h4.5>Nowadays, due to all the development by humans, there is intense climate change. This has caused a decrease in rainfall and an increase in warmer temperatures in places like Cape Town, and has resulted in water scarcity.</h4.5><h3>
Global Warming </h3><h4.5>
Global warming is the increase in the Earth's temperature due to more green house gases in the atmosphere and depletion of the ozone layer.<br>
Global warming is melting the ice caps; the water level has risen drastically. Though there is more water, it is not drinkable, but saline.</h4.5><h3>
Acid Rain</h3><h4.5>
Acid rain is a phenomenon that occurs when there is too much of nitric and/or sulphur oxides in the atmosphere. The rain turns acidic when these oxides combine with the water vapours in the clouds.<br>
This not only corrodes monuments made of marble, but also pollutes the water to a great extent, thus harming aquatic life. Other than disruption of the water cycle, addition of acid rain in groundwater reserves, wells and other water bodies decreases the potability of water.</h4.5><br><br>
<h2>What can we do?</h2><h4.5>
Even though the situation is slowly slipping out of hand, we can work on reducing the exhaustion of harmful gases from our side. We can avoid using aerosols that contain CFCs and decrease the usage of vehicles like cars and bikes which have <i>a lot</i> of vehicle exhaust. Other thna this, the government should follow stricter guidelines and restrictions on the factories to have proper waste management so it gets responsibly disposed off. </h4.5><h4>
The Convention and its achievements</h4><h4.5.5>
The convention is a common framework for transboundary cooperation on air pollution formulated to help with the problem of acid rain. In order to solve this problem, 32 countries in the pan-European region decided to cooperate to reduce air pollution. In 1979, they signed the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, creating the first international treaty to deal with air pollution on a broad regional basis. The Convention entered into force in 1983, laying down the general principles of international cooperation for air pollution abatement and setting up an institutional framework which has since brought together research and policy. Over the years, the number of substances covered by the Convention and its protocols has been gradually extended, notably to ground-level ozone, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals and particulate matter.<br>
The Convention has substantially contributed to the development of international environmental law and has created the essential framework for controlling and reducing the damage to human health and the environment caused by transboundary air pollution. It is a successful example of what can be achieved through intergovernmental cooperation.</h4.5.5>
